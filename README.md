# Next.js 15 App Router: Dynamic Route Rendering Issues

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15's App Router when using dynamic route segments.  Under certain conditions, routes with dynamic segments fail to render, resulting in a blank page or an error.

## Bug Description

The issue seems to be related to how the App Router handles dynamic segments in combination with data fetching.  Sometimes, the data is not fetched correctly, leading to a failure to render the component.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to a dynamic route (e.g., `/product/123`).  You might observe a blank page or an error, instead of the expected component.

## Workaround (Potential Solution)

The provided solution in `bugSolution.js` illustrates a potential workaround. However,  a definitive solution depends on further investigation into the root cause of the issue.  This solution might involve strategies such as more carefully handling asynchronous data fetching or refactoring the route structure.
